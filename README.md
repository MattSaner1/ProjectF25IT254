# ProjectF25IT254
Speech to text project that can listen to lectures or meetings and then create a summary of the presentation. This will be marketed to anyone in a school/professional field that would like to have a quick solution for note taking. This will require a microphone and should use OpenAIs "WhisperAI" model
The file "254proj" was my main portion of the group project where I needed to create a text summarizartion model, and the mian project will be listed under "254FINALproject" which includes the entire project file.
