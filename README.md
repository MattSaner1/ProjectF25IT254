# ProjectF25IT254
Speech to text project that can listen to lectures or meetings and then create a summary of the presentation. This will be marketed to anyone in a school/professional field that would like to have a quick solution for note taking. This will require a microphone and should use OpenAIs "WhisperAI" model.

254finalproject is the final project. 254finalarudino is the arduino code for the board. 254proj is my portion of the project, the summarization of the text. 

Here is a youtube video showing the summarization https://youtu.be/HJXjjPcYo4M
